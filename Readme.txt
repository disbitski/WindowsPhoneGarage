Summary:

This code was taken from a workshop I did at Flash and The City 2011 (http://bit.ly/wp7fatc). It focuses on building Windows Phone 7 applications with Microsoft Silverlight. You will see firsthand how to use Visual Studio 2010 and Expression Blend to develop and debug projects. It also utilizes built-in templates, layouts, styling, controls, page navigation, application bars, and state management.
